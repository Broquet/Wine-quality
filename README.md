# Wine-quality

# Introduction
This clean dataset contains 1,599 red wines with 12 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Wines contain several chemicals, such as citric acid, chlorides, sulfur and so on. This project will focus on the following question: which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?
