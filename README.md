# Wine-quality

# Introduction
This clean dataset contains 1,599 red wines with 12 variables on the chemical properties of the wine. At least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). Wines contain several chemicals, such as citric acid, chlorides, sulfur and so on. This project aims to define which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines.
